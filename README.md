## Installation

```bash
yarn add @untemps/loan-schedule
```

## Usage

Import `LoanSchedule`:

```javascript
import { LoanSchedule } from '@untemps/loan-schedule'
```

Create an instance of `LoanSchedule` passing three objects:

```javascript
// Settings object that describes the properties of the loan (see below "Loan Settings")
const loanSettings = {
	amount: 79950, // Amount of the loan in any currency
	term: 25, // Loan term in years
	interestRate: 2, // Interest rate in percentage
	insuranceRate: 0.5, // Insurance rate in percentage
}

// List of amortizations monthly paid until the term of the loan (see below "Loan Amortizations")
const loanAmortizations = [
	{
		label: 'Rent', // Label of the amortization.
		value: 600, // Amount of the maortization.
		type: LoanScheduleAmortizationType.CREDIT, // Type of the amortization: "credit" or "debit"
	},
	{
		label: 'Payment',
		type: LoanScheduleAmortizationType.DEBIT,
		compute: LoanScheduleCompute.PAYMENT, // Computation method of the amortization (optional). That means the amount has to be automatically calculated by the class. "payment" and "insurance" are available so far.
	},
	{
		label: 'Property Tax',
		value: 30,
		rate: 5, // Yearly inflation rate of the amortization (optional).
		type: LoanScheduleAmortizationType.DEBIT,
	},
]

// Configuration of the output (see below "Configuration")
const config = {
    headers: {
        year: {
            label: 'Ann√©e',
        },
        balance: {
            label: 'Solde',
        },
    },
}

const schedule = new LoanSchedule(loanSettings, loanAmortizations, config);
```
